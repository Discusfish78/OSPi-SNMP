# OSPi-SNMP
A plugin for Dan-in-CA/SIP to add SNMP polling and control based on returned OID values

The purpose of this project is to contain my code for a plugin to allow an opensprinkler Pi to poll SNMP device for temperature and humidity, and use that to control sprinklers (in addition to watering schedules). It is intended to run one or more lines of misters, or other similar devices, to maintain temperature and humidity with acceptable parameters within a greenhouse environment.
